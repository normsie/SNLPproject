GECToR:

The original and full implementation of GECToR can be found [here](https://github.com/grammarly/gector). We recommend you to use Python 3.7 and the specific version of all libraries mentioned in ./gector/requirements.txt to run GECToR. You might run into errors while building wheels for these libraries if you use the latest versions.
